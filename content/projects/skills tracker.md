### 🚀 Features

- **📡 RESTful API**  
  Built with **Flask**, the backend handles skill entries, updates, and retrieval via a clean, scalable API with `Flask-CORS` support.

  The frontend, built in **React** and powered by `react-chartjs-2`, provides dynamic visualizations including spidar radar charts that reflect skill progression.

- **🐳 Dockerized Setup**  
  Easily spin up both backend and frontend environments using **Docker Compose** for consistent local development.
