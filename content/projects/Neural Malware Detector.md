## Project Overview

**Neural Malware Detector** is a machine learning powered web application built with **Flask** that classifies uploaded files as benign or malicious. It combines a **Random Forest** ensemble with a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives, trained on samples sourced from VirusTotal.

### 🔍 Features

- **File Upload Interface**  
  Users can upload any executable file, which is processed in real time.

- **Dual‑Model Detection**  
  - **Random Forest** for quick, interpretable classification  
  - **RNN** for deeper pattern recognition

- **Visual Feedback**  
  Displays probability scores and a clear “Malicious” or “Benign” verdict on a dashboard.
