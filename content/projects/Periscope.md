## Project Overview

**Periscope** is an AI‑Enabled System designed to streamline Cyber Incident Detection and Response within cloud environments. It integrates multiple analytical modules to provide end‑to‑end visibility and automated alerting for security teams.

---

### 🌟 Core Modules

- **🦠 Malware Analysis**  
  Automated static and dynamic analysis pipelines to fingerprint and classify suspicious binaries.

- **📊 Network Traffic Classifier**  
  A machine‑learning‑driven classifier that inspects packet captures and labels flows as benign or malicious.

- **🔐 Web Intrusion Detection**  
  Signature‑ and anomaly‑based monitoring of HTTP logs to detect common web attacks (SQLi, XSS, RCE).
---

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **Language:** Python (90%) 
- **Containerization:** Docker (7.4%) for reproducible deployments 
- **Frontend:** HTML templates (2.6%) for lightweight dashboards   
- **AI Frameworks:** leverages scikit‑learn or TensorFlow for model training  
- **Cloud Integration:** supports ingestion from AWS S3 buckets and Azure Blob Storage  

---

### 🤔 What I Learned

- Designing **modular architectures** that allow independent scaling of detection components.  
- Integrating **machine learning** into real‑time security workflows.  
- Orchestrating **Dockerized services** for consistent cloud deployments.
